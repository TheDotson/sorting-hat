# Sorting Hat
This is an exercise that sorts an array of students into one of Hogwarts Houses from Harry Potter with the option to expel the students to keep them from being printed as a data card.

## Instructions
Program can be run on a local webserver. Student names are entered into the form field that generates once you click on the "Commence the ceremony!" button.  The form won't accept blank entries, and will put the entered names into a blank array.  From there, a random number generator will assign one of the 4 houses to the student data object.  Once the student cards are populated, there will be a button to expel the student.  This changes a boolean variable that is present when all student objects are make to Falese; preventing the "expelled" cards from being generated again.
